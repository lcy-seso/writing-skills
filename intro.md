# An Important Difference between Writing and Talking: Point and Support

_In writing, any idea that you advance must be supported with specific reasons or details._


# Structure of the Traditional Essay

# The First and Second Steps in Essay Writing

## Begin with a point or thesis

### Understanding Thesis Statements

>A good thesis statement does two things. First, it tells readers an _essay's topic_. Second, it presents
>the writer's _attitude_, _opinion_, _idea_, or _point_ about that topic. This is often referred to as the
>_author's claim_.

### Writing a Good Thesis

To start, you need a topic that is neither too broad nor too narrow.

1. limit your subject.
1. narrow it down until you have a thesis that you can deal with.
    - clustering
    - making a list

Sometimes, a subject must go through several stages of limiting before it is narrow enough to write about.

### Mistakes that Produce an Ineffective Essay

1. simply announce the subject rather than state a true thesis

    >Remember, a thesis statement must make a point about a limited subject.

1. write a thesis that is too broad

    >If a thesis is too broad, it will not be able to support adequately. Your thesis statement should be
    >focused enough that it can be effectively supported in a (five-paragraph essay) essay.

1. write a thesis that is too narrow

    >A simple fact that does not require any support is sometimes called a _dead-end statement_: there is no
    >place to go with it.
    >A thesis statement must be broad enough to require support in an essay.

1. write a thesis containing more than one idea

    > The point of an essay is to communicate a _single_ main idea to readers. To be as clear as possible,
    > then, try to limit your thesis statement to the single key idea you want your readers to know.

## Support the thesis with specific evidence
